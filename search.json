    "text": "In 1979, two Swedish bands released albums. One of these albums, Voulez-Vous, was recorded by ABBA in Polar Studios, at its time, one of the most advanced — and expensive — recording studios in the world. The other album, We're Only in it for the Drugs, by the Swedish Punk band Ebba Grön was recorded on a mobile 8-channel mixer in a closed industrial office. Both these albums are great, but the resources available to create them were vastly different.\nThere is a prevalent perception that machine learning is only for those with deep pockets. For example, in 2022, Google created a new Language Model, PaLM, but the cost of training such a model is estimated to be between $9M to $23M. As a result, discussions of machine learning often focus on large tech companies because they are deemed to be the only ones with the finances to develop and use this technology.\nMachine learning, and in particular a branch of machine learning called deep learning, has dramatically impacted a range of domains over the past ten years. There has been a growing interest in using machine learning in gallery, library, archive and museum (GLAM) institutions. A barrier to further adoption of machine learning in the GLAM sector is the perception that it requires extensive technical skill, data, computing power and other resources.\nIn this book, we want to show that just as Ebba Grön was able to record a seminal album without the resources available to ABBA, GLAM institutions can use machine learning for practical work without the resources of Google."

    "text": "The growing interest in using Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning in a GLAM setting is demonstrated by the many initiatives and groups aiming to develop communities and best practices around applying AI/Machine Learning in GLAM settings. These initiatives include; ai4lam and CENEL's AI in Libraries Network Group.\nThere are also several funded projects which seek to explore this area, including the AEOLIAN Network, Unlocking our Digital Past and the AURA Network.\nThese more academic projects can produce a range of resources that can be helpful for GLAM institutions wanting to use machine learning. These primarily include publications, code, and, to a lesser extent, datasets. Whilst these projects are essential as part of the development of machine learning within the sector, there are potential limitations to these projects being the sole method of building capacity for machine learning projects within the GLAM community.\nThere is also a growing body of materials focused on teaching GLAM staff topics related to machine learning. A review of some of this material has been carried out by the Teaching and Learning working group of the AI4LAM network Darby et al. (2022).\nThis material includes general introductions to machine learning for GLAM staff Strien et al. (2022), practical introductions to using the Python programming language for machine learning 1 and introductions to a specific tool. 2\nWhile this more ‘formal’ teaching material is an essential part of enabling GLAM staff to engage with machine learning, there are limitations to relying only on this material. These materials often need to focus on a particular topic, concept or approach within machine learning, for example, an introduction to Named Entity Recognition. However, learning how to train a machine learning model, or use an existing model, is only one part of a more extensive pipeline for practically making use of machine learning in a GLAM setting."

In particular, we are keen to address ‘business as usual’ use cases of machine learning in GLAM institutions as we believe there is massive scope for using machine learning methods across a range of ‘mundane’ GLAM activities."

    "text": "1.4 Practical machine learning projects?\nA report has suggested that 85% of AI projects “ultimately fail to deliver on their intended promises to business”5. This stat might be a little dubious, but there is some truth to the claim that machine learning projects can be challenging. By a “machine learning project,” we mean a project that intends to use machine learning to solve a problem. Part of this process could include creating new machine learning models, but it could also rely on existing models.\nWe use the term “practical” here to try and distinguish this type of project slightly from other projects which may involve using machine learning in a GLAM setting but are more focused on research. The outputs of these projects may need to integrate less tightly into existing business workflows and processes. This isn’t to say that these kinds of projects won’t have their own challenges, but they will likely be different. ‘Practical’ machine learning projects could include workflows and processes that end users don’t see and are likely to be the kinds of projects that may struggle to get external funding.\n\n\n\n\nAmeisen, Emmanuel. 2020.
