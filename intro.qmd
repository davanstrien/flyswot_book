# Introduction

The growing interest in using Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning
in a GLAM setting is demonstrated by the many initiatives and groups
aiming to develop communities and best practices around applying
AI/Machine Learning in GLAM settings. These initiatives include;
[ai4lam](https://sites.google.com/view/ai4lam) and [CENEL\'s AI in
Libraries Network Group](https://github.com/CENL-Network-Group-AI/).

There are also several funded projects which seek to explore this area,
including the [AEOLIAN Network](https://www.aeolian-network.net/),
[Unlocking our Digital Past](https://unlockingourdigitalpast.com/) and
the [AURA Network](https://www.aura-network.net/).

These more academic projects can produce a range of resources that can
be helpful for GLAM institutions wanting to use machine learning. These
primarily include publications, code, and, to a lesser extent, datasets.
Whilst these projects are essential as part of the development of
machine learning within the sector, there are potential limitations to
these projects being the sole method of building capacity for machine
learning projects within the GLAM community.

- They often have to have some academic focus to get funding, so projects tackling more mundane or 'business' problems may not be funded. This might potentially limit the types of machine learning demonstrated by these projects.
- The components of the machine learning process documented through academic publications are often skewed towards particular stages of the overall pipeline, in particular, the development of new models or novel algorithms. These parts of the process can be very important but only make up a part of using machine learning for practical applications.  
- Academic projects often have different goals than 'business as usual' projects. For academic projects, publishing in well-respected journals remains the primary goal. For BAU projects the outcome is to 'solve' a problem. Whilst these can intersect, there can be tensions between the two. For example, an academic publication might be achieved by improving performance on a benchmark dataset at the expense of using a much larger model, whilst the BAU use case might have constraints on what resources can be used for training/inference (a topic we pick up later in this book).

There is also a growing body of materials focused on teaching GLAM staff
topics related to machine learning. A review of some of this material
has been carried out by the Teaching and Learning working group of the
AI4LAM network @Darby2022AITR.

This material includes general introductions to machine learning for GLAM staff @pmlr-v170-strien22a,
practical introductions to using the Python programming language for machine learning [^1]
and introductions to a specific tool. [^annif]

While this more 'formal' teaching material is an essential part of
enabling GLAM staff to engage with machine learning, there are
limitations to relying only on this material. These materials often need
to focus on a particular topic, concept or approach within machine
learning, for example, an introduction to [Named Entity Recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition).
However, learning how to train a machine learning model, or use an
existing model, is only one part of a more extensive pipeline for
practically making use of machine learning in a GLAM setting.

### What's missing?

A recent review of teaching materials
@Darby2022AITR
for GLAM staff identified that much of the existing material was focused on
one stage of the machine learning pipeline, namely the 'creating and
training a model' part of the process. Whilst this is an important
component of applying machine learning, many other stages of the
process - particularly when seeking to use machine learning in a
'practical' setting - are important.

There has been a growing number of books published in recent years that aim to cover more of the end-to-end pipeline of machine learning products @ameisen2020building, @huyen2022designing, @lakshmanan2020machine. Alongside this, there has also been the development of courses like 'Full Stack Deep Learning'[^fsdl] and 'Made with ML'[^mademl] which go beyond the model training components of machine learning projects. These resources are very useful but some of the approaches adopted in these settings may not translate to the GLAM sector. 

This book aims to partially fill the gap of open documentation about a
machine learning project undertaken in a GLAM institution (The British Library). It is not
intended as a guide to best practice but instead offers an outline of
the approach we took with the hope that anyone wanting to embark on a
machine learning project in a GLAM setting can learn from our
experiences.

## What\'s covered

The book covers a few key areas:

-   the motivation of the project
-   the various stages in the pipeline:
    -   data collection
    -   data versioning
    -   model development
    -   model evaluation
    -   tracking results
    -   deployment
    -   updating the model

All of these are discussed with a particular focus on how they fit into
existing workflows and how they can be done pragmatically.

## What isn\'t covered

This isn\'t a guide on how to do machine learning itself. Although some
of the sections touch upon some of these considerations, this book
won\'t explain everything thoroughly. If you want a more
conceptual introduction to machine learning, we recommend
[https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/machine-learning-librarians-archivists](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/machine-learning-librarians-archivists/).
For a hands-on introduction, we recommended
[https://course.fast.ai/](https://course.fast.ai/).

## Who is this for?

We hope that this book will be useful for other GLAM institutions
wanting to embark on machine learning projects. In particular, we are
keen to address 'business as usual' use cases of machine learning in
GLAM institutions as we believe there is massive scope for using machine
learning methods across a range of 'mundane' GLAM activities.

## Practical machine learning projects?

A report has suggested that 85% of AI projects "ultimately fail to deliver on
their intended promises to business"[^report]. This stat might be a little
dubious, but there is some truth to the claim that machine learning
projects can be challenging. By a "machine learning project," we mean a
project that intends to use machine learning to solve a problem. Part of
this process could include creating new machine learning models, but it
could also rely on existing models.

We use the term "practical" here to try and distinguish this type of
project slightly from other projects which may involve using machine
learning in a GLAM setting but are more focused on research. The outputs
of these projects may need to integrate less tightly into existing
business workflows and processes. This isn't to say that these kinds of
projects won't have their own challenges, but they will likely be
different. 'Practical' machine learning projects could include workflows
and processes that end users don't see and are likely to be the kinds of
projects that may struggle to get external funding.
